    <h1 class="underlined">My experience with HTML</h1>

    <p>
      HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, serves as a basis for everything that
      is seen on websites. I will continue to apply the concepts that were
      learned in future computer science classes that I plan to take in the
      future. Moreover, I see myself creating or helping others soon with the
      creation of a website, for example for my momâ€™s shop. The area that
      impacted me most as a student is the implementation of images as well as
      hyperlinks, both which I have integrated into my portfolio.
