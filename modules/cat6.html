    <p>
      Branching is a feature in version control systems that allow you to take
      more risks with your coding. You would have your current version of code,
      then take your risk, if it doesn't work, you can just revert to the
      already functioning version. In git, these bug fixes, or changes, both big
      and small, create a branch to represent these changes. The concept of
      version control can be applied to coding as well as real-life, in school
      projects some things that might limit a studentâ€™s ability is the fear of
      failure. This fear can be negated by version control of documents and
      work. The most valuable element that I pulled from the Git N Going module
      is version control. I especially used this in the micro bit project when
      we were constantly making risks such as trying to turn the micro bit into
      a controller.
